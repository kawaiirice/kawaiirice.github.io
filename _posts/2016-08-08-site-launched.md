#Hooray!

"Hello World!" Today is the day that I decided to be curious and create a website on github.
I found a really helpful guide online for setting up Jekyll and I can't believe I didn't know 
about this sooner. It's nice to know that I don't have to change multiple *html* files because
of a slight modification on navbar or footer. 

I also decided to try creating a blog which is easy to read and write using Markdown. The syntax
is so much nicer than HTML. 

Once I get back on track and review what I've learned about web programming, you'll see more content. _Hopefully_.
