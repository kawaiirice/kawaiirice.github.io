Greetings guys, and Happy pre-Halloween! It's a Friday and for some reason people would rather 
celebrate for Halloween on a Friday instead of on a Monday. What are you guys dressing up as 
for Halloween? I haven't dressed up for Halloween since high school and being on a college campus, 
trick-or-treating is not the same. However, at work there's a Halloween party and the kids get to 
go around the office and trick-or-treat at desks with balloons. The balloons indicate that there is candy. 

Anyone else participating in #Hacktoberfest? I'm just one pull request away from getting that t-shirt! :)

_Hopefully_ I can update more next semester once crazy classes and job searching is over. I'm not making 
any promises, but I would like to keep a blog and maybe include some pictures of my *adventurous* life.
